# Introduction
Cadise is a physically-based renderer written in C++17, taking some other renderers ([PBRT-v3](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3), [Photon-v2](https://github.com/TzuChieh/Photon-v2), [Tungsten](https://github.com/tunabrain/tungsten), etc) as references. The main purpose of a renderer is to solve the integral problem described in [rendering equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_equation), which is more often known as light transport simulation.
