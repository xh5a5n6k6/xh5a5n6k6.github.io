My areas of interest include physically-based rendering and game development.

# Inspiration
This site is inspired by [Yining Karl Li](https://www.yiningkarlli.com/) and [Benedikt Bitterli](https://benedikt-bitterli.me/). The titles/subtitles are typeset in [Geo Sans Light](https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/geo-sans-light/) downloaded from [CUFON Fonts](https://www.cufonfonts.com/), and the body text is typeset in default Sans-Serif font which is OS-dependent.

This Jekyll theme [plaintro](https://github.com/xh5a5n6k6/plaintro/) is now released. Check it out [on Github](https://github.com/xh5a5n6k6/plaintro/)!
