# About
Hi! I am Chia-Yu Chou.

I received my Master degree from [Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia](https://www.inm.ntu.edu.tw/main.php) at National Taiwan University. My areas of interest include physically-based rendering and game development. 

Previously, I did my undergraduate studies in [Computer Science and Information Engineering](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/) at National Taiwan University. 

I interned at [Rayark Inc.](https://www.rayark.com/en/) in summer 2018.

# Inspiration
This site is inspired by [Yining Karl Li](https://www.yiningkarlli.com/) and [Benedikt Bitterli](https://benedikt-bitterli.me/). The titles/subtitles are typeset in [Geo Sans Light](https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/geo-sans-light/) downloaded from [CUFON Fonts](https://www.cufonfonts.com/), and the body text is typeset in default Sans-Serif font which is OS-dependent.

This Jekyll template ([plaintro](https://github.com/xh5a5n6k6/plaintro/)) is almost finished, and full usage instructions of it are under construction.
