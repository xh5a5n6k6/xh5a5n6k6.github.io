# Welcome
Hi there! I am Chia-Yu Chou.

I am a software engineer (client) at [Rayark Inc.](https://www.rayark.com/en/). Prior to work, I completed my Master's degree from [Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia](https://www.inm.ntu.edu.tw/main.php) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). My areas of interest include physically-based rendering and game development.
