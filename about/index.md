# About
Hi! I am Chia-Yu Chou.

I am currently doing my Master degree in Computer Science & Information Engineering at National Taiwan University. My areas of interest include physically based rendering and game development. 

Previously, I did my undergraduate studies in Computer Science & Information Engineering at National Taiwan University. 

I interned at [Rayark Inc.](https://www.rayark.com/) in summer 2018.

# Inspiration
This site is inspired by [Yining Karl Li](https://www.yiningkarlli.com/) and [Benedikt Bitterli](https://benedikt-bitterli.me/). The titles/subtitles are typeset in [Geo Sans Light](https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/geo-sans-light/) downloaded from [CUFON Fonts](https://www.cufonfonts.com/), and the body text is typeset in default Sans-Serif font which is OS-dependent.

This Jekyll template ([cychou](https://github.com/xh5a5n6k6/cychou/)) is still in development, and I hope it will soon be finished.
